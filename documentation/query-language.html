<h3>Basic components</h3>

Queries in the CorpusSearch query language are built from the following
basic components:

<ul>
<li><a href="search-functions.html" target="_new">search function calls</a>, which look
    for basic relationships among nodes, such as "dominates" or "precedes",
<li><a href="search-functions.html" target="_new">arguments to search function
    calls</a>, which describe the nodes involved in the relationships
    being searched for, and
<li><a href="#log-ops">logical operators</a>, which are used as in basic
    formal logic.
</ul>

<a name="search">
<h3>Search function calls</h3>

The most basic query consists of a single <a href="search-functions.html"
target="_new">search function</a> call with associated arguments.  For
instance, the following query searches for nodes labeled "NP-PRD"
(predicate noun phrase) that immediately dominate nodes labeled "N"
(noun):

<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP-PRD iDominates N)
</pre>
</blockquote>

Here is a sentence that matches the query.

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*
For he 's a jolly good fellow.
*~/

/*
    1 IP-MAT: 9 NP-SBJ, 16 N
*/

(0 (1 IP-MAT (2 CONJ For)
             (4 NP-SBJ (5 PRO he))
             (7 BEP 's)
             (9 NP-PRD (10 D a) (12 ADJ jolly) (14 ADJ good) (16 N fellow)))
             (18 . .))
</pre>
</blockquote>

In addition to "iDominates", CorpusSearch has many other search functions,
which are described in detail in <a href="search-functions.html" target="_new">their own section</a>.

<a name="log-ops">
<h3>Logical operators</h3>

Search function calls can be combined using <a href="#log-ops">logical
operators</a>.  There are two types:

<ul>
<li><a href="#argument-operators">Argument operators</a> act on arguments
    to search functions.
<li><a href="#search-function-operators">Search function operators</a> act
    on search functions.
</ul>

<a name="argument-operators">
<h3>Argument operators</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="#pipe">Argument "or"</a> (|, read "pipe")
<li><a href="#bang">Argument "not"</a> (!, read "bang")
    <ul>
    <li><a href="#bang-list">Argument "not" negates entire lists</a>
    <li><a href="#bang-one">One argument "not" per search function</a>
    <li><a href="#bang-index">Argument "not" before prefix indices</a>
    </ul>
</ul>

<a name="pipe">
<h3>Argument "or"</h3>

<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="caution.GIF">
<td><a href="troubleshooting.html#adjacent-pipe-symbols" target="_new">Two
    adjacent pipes</a> (||), whether in a command file or a definition
    file, will abort any search.
</table>

<p>
Any number of arguments to a search function may be linked together into a
list using "|" (argument "or" or "pipe").  For instance,

<blockquote>
<pre>
(BE*|DO*|HV*|MD|VB* iPrecedes NP-SBJ*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

means "BE* or DO* or HV* or MD or VB* immediately precedes NP-SBJ*" and
will find sentences like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*

             (14 VAN cast)
             (16 RP down))
   (18 ID CMKEMPE,2.12))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="bang">
<h3>Argument "not"</h3>

"!" (argument "not", read as "bang") negates (= returns the complement of)
arguments to search functions.  For instance, the following query finds
sentences with subjects that immediately dominate some category other than
a pronoun.

<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP-SBJ* iDoms !PRO*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<pre>

             (24 ADVP (25 ADV wel))
             (27 E_S .))
      (29 ID CMHORSES,87.17))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="bang-list">
<h4>Argument "not" negates entire lists</h4>

"!" cannot be used to negate individual members of a list constructed with
"|", and queries of the following form will abort:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP-SBJ* iDoms N|!D|!ADJ)
</pre>
</blockquote>

Instead, "!" must precede lists, and it is interpreted as negating the
entire list (not just the first member).  So the following query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP-SBJ* iDoms !N|D|ADJ)
</pre>
</blockquote>

means "NP-SBJ* immediately dominates some node other than N, D, or ADJ",
and it finds sentences with bare pronouns subjects like the following,
which are not intended by the ill-formed query:

<blockquote>
<pre> 
/~*
and he made them grete chere out of mesure
(CMMALORY-M4,2.13)
*~/
/*
1 IP-MAT:  4 NP-SBJ, 5 PRO

(0  (1 IP-MAT (2 CONJ and)
	      (4 NP-SBJ (5 PRO he))
	      (7 VBD made)
	      (9 NP-DTV (10 PRO them))
	      (12 NP-ACC (13 ADJ grete) (15 N chere))
	      (17 ADVP (18 ADV out)
		       (20 PP (21 P of)
			      (23 NP (24 N mesure)))))
    (26 ID CMMALORY-M4,2.13))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The ill-formed query <u>can</u> be formulated in CorpusSearch by splitting
up the single condition into two conditions combined with AND:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    (NP-SBJ* iDoms N)
AND (NP-SBJ* iDoms !D|!ADJ)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="bang-one">
<h4>One argument "not" per search function</h4>

CorpusSearch does not allow you to negate both arguments to a single
search function.  So queries of the following form will abort:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(!NP-SBJ* iPrecedes !VBD)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Queries of the following form are fine.

<blockquote>
<pre>
    (NP-SBJ* iDoms !PRO*)
AND (NP-SBJ* iPrecedes !VBD)
</pre>
</blockquote>

It's true that the entire query contains more than one "!"  operator, but
each individual search function (iDoms, iPrecedes) contains only one.

<a name="bang-index">
<h4>Argument "not" before prefix indices</h4>

If you need to use both "!" and <a href="#prefix-indices">prefix
indices</a>, "!"  goes before the indices.  This makes sense because the
prefix index tells CorpusSearch which node is meant, and then "!" tells
CorpusSearch to exclude that node from the output.

<p>
For instance, suppose you're looking for sentences with a subject that
precedes the object, and where neither the subject nor the object is a
pronoun.  The following query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    (NP-SBJ* precedes NP-OB1*)
AND (NP-SBJ* iDoms ![1]PRO*)
AND (NP-OB1* iDoms ![2]PRO*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

will find sentences like this one:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*

/*

             (11 NP-OB1 (12 D a) (14 ADJ good) (16 N hors))
             (18 E_S .))

AND returns trees in which both conjuncts match within a single boundary
node.  For instance, this query:

finds this sentence:

<a name="OR">
<h3>OR <font color="red">(deprecated)</font></h3>

results.  Its functionality can normally be achieved with argument "or".
When argument "or" is not sufficient, <a href="coding.html" target="_new">coding

</table>

<p>
OR encodes inclusive disjunction. "(FOO) OR (BAR)" returns all subtrees
rooted in an instance of the query's selected node boundary with either
the property "FOO" or the property "BAR" or <b>both</b>.  "FOO" and "BAR"
may consist of single search functions or may themselves be built up out
of conjunctions, disjunctions and negations of simple search functions.

<p>
NOT returns trees rooted in the node boundary that do not contain the

in that none of the arguments need to appear in the domain defined by
the boundary node.

<p>
For instance, 

<blockquote>
<pre>
NOT(NP* iPrecedes VB*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

returns trees that do not contain the structure "(NP* iPrecedes
VB*)", including those that contain neither NP* nor VB*.

<p>
By contrast,

<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP* iPrecedes !VB*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

returns trees that must contain NP* (namely ones that iPrecede any node
except VB*), and

<blockquote>
<pre>
(!NP* iPrecedes VB*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

returns trees that must contains VB* (namely one that are iPreceded by
NP*).

<a name="reg-exps">
<h3>Regular expressions</h3>

CorpusSearch allows the use of basic regular expression syntax in the
arguments to functions, but does not support full regular expression
syntax.  (This is because of weaknesses in the version of Java that
CorpusSearch is written in.)

<a name="regexp-square">
<h4>Square brackets</h4> 

The use of square brackets discussed in what follows is distinct from
their use in connection with <a href="#prefix-indices">prefix indices</a>.
As the name implies, prefix indices precede node labels.  The square
brackets discussed here are part of the specification of the node labels
themselves.

<p>
Expressions enclosed in square brackets specify alternatives.  For
instance, "[xyz]" stands for a single character that is either an "x", a
"y", or a "z". (Equivalently, one could search for "x|y|z".  Similarly,
"BE[DP]" and "BED|BEP" amount to the same.)

<p>
CorpusSearch doesn't support ranges such as "[A-Z]", "[a-z]", and "[0-9]".
These must be expressed as complete lists of alternatives (for instance,
"[0123456789]").

<a name="regexp-period">
<h4>Period</h4>

The wildcard character "." (period) matches any letter or digit.

<a name="regexp-asterisk">
<h4>Asterisk</h4>  

The wildcard character "*" (asterisk) matches any string, including the
null string.  "*" may be used anywhere in the string specifying the
function argument - beginning, middle or end.  For instance, "CP*" matches
any label beginning with the letters "CP" ("CP", "CP-ADV", "CP-QUE-SPE",
etc.).  "*-SPE" matches any label ending in "-SPE", and "*hersum*" matches
any string containing the substring "hersum" ("hersum" itself,
"hersumnesse", "unhersumnesse", etc.).

<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="caution.GIF">
<td>"NP*" matches all types of noun phrases ("NP-SBJ", "NP-OB1", etc.),
    but also "NPR" and its variants.  The latter matches are not usually
    intended.  To avoid this problem, either add a hyphen ("NP-*") or make
    reference to appropriate definitions from a <a href="def.html"
    target="_new">definition file</a>.  A more radical solution is to
    replace "NPR" by a non-interfering label like "NR" via
    a <a href="revision.html" target="_new">revision query</a> or a sed
    script.
</table>

<p>
As mentioned above, regular expression support in Java is not perfect.  In
particular, after square brackets, ".*" and "*" behave erratically.

<blockquote>
<pre>
gi[uv]*            &larr; matches "giu" and "giv", but not "giue", "giuen", ... "give", "given", ...
                     (the asterisk is unexpectedly inert)

gi[uv].*           &larr; matches "giue", "giuen", ... "give", "given", ... but not "giu" or "giv"
	             (the asterisk unexpectedly disallows zero instances of the wildcard period)
</pre>
</blockquote>

In general, ".*" after square bracket gives the desired result, but
refuses to match zero instances of the wildcard character ".", contrary to
expectation.  If those matches are important, searches need to include
disjunctions along the following lines (here, the first disjunct doesn't
contain an asterisk, since including it is both unnecessary and
confusing):

<blockquote>
<pre>
gi[uv]|gi[uv].*    &larr; matches "giu", "giue" "giuen", ... "giv", "give", "given", ...
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="escaping">
<a name="esc-asterisk">
<h3>Escaping special expressions</h3>

<h4>Asterisk</h4> 

As just discussed, "*" is ordinarily interpreted as a wildcard character.
In searches for "*" as a literal character in the text, the wildcard
interpretation needs to be disabled or "escaped".  The standard way of
doing this is by prefixing the asterisk with a backslash (\).  For
instance, the following query with unescaped asterisks:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP* dominates *con*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

finds noun phrases containing words like "<u>con</u>tradiction" or
"un<u>con</u>stitutional" or "Rubi<u>con</u>".  If the search is intended
to find noun phrases with subjects elided under conjunction ("*con*"),
where the asterisks are part of the text, the asterisks need to be
escaped:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP* dominates \*con\*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

It is also possible to search for literal asterisks by enclosing them
in square brackets.

<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP* dominates [*]con[*])
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Escaped and unescaped asterisks can be - and very often are - combined in
a single search.  For instance, here are two alternative ways to search
for traces of the form "*T*-1", "*T*-2", etc.  The two queries are not
completely equivalent, as indicated in the example.

<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP* dominates \*T*)       &larr; matches *T*-12, *T34, *T*; doesn't match T*, T-5 

(NP* dominates \*T\*-*)    &larr; matches *T*-12; doesn't match *T34, *T*, T*, T-5

</pre>
</blockquote>

Empty categories in general (which always begin with an asterisk in the
PPCHE) can be searched for with "\**".

<a name="esc-period">
<h4>Period</h4>

In searches for literal periods in the text, the period needs to be
escaped, either by prefixing them with a backslash <nobr>(\.)</nobr> or by
enclosing them in square brackets <nobr>([.]).</nobr>

<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="caution.GIF">
<td>If you fail to find literal periods when you expect to, recall that
     period is on CorpusSearch's
     <a href="command-file.html#ignore_nodes" target="_new">ignore_nodes</a>
     list by default.  So you will have to explicitly "unignore" it by
     editing the "ignore_nodes" command, either in your query file or by
     changing the default setting in your <a href="pref.html"
     target="_new">preference file</a>.
</table>

<a name="esc-integer">
<h4>Integers</h4>

Integer arguments are expected for certain search functions (for instance,
among others, <a href="search-functions.html#iDomsNumber" target="_new">iDomsNumber</a>),
but not allowed for others.  For instance, "exists" doesn't take an
integer argument, and so the following query crashes.

<blockquote>
<pre>
query: (1929 exists)           &larr;  CRASH !
</pre>
</blockquote>

To find tokens containing integers, the integer needs to be escaped.

<blockquote>
<pre>
query: (\1929 exists)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="same-instance">
<h3>Same instance</h3>

If a CorpusSearch query contains (exactly) the same label more than
once, CorpusSearch assumes by default that each occurrence of the label
refers to the same node in the tree, and we say that CorpusSearch
enforces <b>"same instance".</b>  Thus, the following query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    (ADVP precedes HV*|MD|VB*)
AND (HV*|MD|VB* precedes NP-SBJ*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

matches tokens with an adverb preceding a modal, and that same modal
preceding a subject.

<p>
"Same instance" is triggered by strings that are identical character by
character.  Strings that are not character-by-character identical do not
trigger "same instance", even if the strings are extensionally equivalent.
For instance, the following query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    (ADVP precedes HV*|MD|VB*)          &larr; HV* &lt; MD
AND (MD|HV*|VB* precedes NP-SBJ*)       &larr; MD &lt; HV*
</pre>
</blockquote>

matches tokens with an adverb preceding a modal in one clause and a form
of HAVE preceding a subject in some other clause.  (It also matches the
tokens returned by the earlier query.)  The reason that "same instance"
isn't enforced in the second query is that "HV*" and "MD" appear in
different orders in the two clauses of the query.

<p>
When search expressions become complex, it rapidly becomes difficult to
tell whether they are character-by-character identical and whether they
will trigger "same instance" or not.  This is one of the many reasons to
use <a href="def.html" target="_new">definition files</a>.

<a name="prefix-indices">
<h3>Prefix indices</h3>

Certain queries require <u>not</u> triggering "same instance".  For
instance, if you are searching for two sister noun phrases, the
following query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
NP* hasSister NP*
</pre>
</blockquote>

will not give the desired result.  In fact, it will not generate any hits
at all because "hasSister" is not defined as a reflexive relation
(in other words, CorpusSearch doesn't treat a node as't its own sister).

<p>
When it is necessary to avoid "same instance" interpretations, the
intended reference of arguments needs to be explicitly specified with
<b>prefix indices</b>, as in the following query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
([1]NP* hasSister [2]NP*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

Prefix indices are enclosed by square brackets ([ ]).  Arguments with the
same index refer to the same node (in other words, they explicitly trigger
"same instance").  Arguments with distinct indices are forced to refer to
distinct nodes.

<p>
As with "same instance", labels that are intended to refer to distinct
nodes in the tree must be character-by-character identical (except for
the prefix index).

<p>
Here is a slightly more complex example of a query with prefix indices:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    ([1]NP* hasSister [2]NP*) 
AND ([1]NP* iDoms [3]PRO)
AND ([2]NP* iDoms [4]PRO)
</pre>
</blockquote>

This query finds sentences with two sister NPs, each of which
immediately dominates (its own) PRO.

If the prefix indices on the two instances of PRO were omitted, the query
would return no hits, since it would be requiring one and the same PRO
node to be the child of the two distinct NP nodes.

<p>
Here's a final example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
query: (IP-SMC iDoms [1]NP*) AND ([1]NP* iDoms [3]\**)
   AND (IP-SMC iDoms [2]NP*) AND ([2]NP* iDoms [4]\**)
</pre>
</blockquote>

This query searches for an IP-SMC node which immediately dominates two
distinct NP* nodes, each immediately dominating (its own) trace.  The two
mentions of "IP-SMC" refer to the same node in the tree (because "same
instance" is enforced by default).  But "[1]NP*" and "[2]NP*" refer to
different nodes (because of the distinct prefix indices), and the same is
true of the traces "[3]\**" and "[4]\**".

<p>
The above query finds sentences like this one:
<blockquote>
