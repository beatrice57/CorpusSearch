<h3>Preliminaries</h3>

<ul>
<p>
<p>
<li>If you are using a Unix-derived system such as Linux and MacOS, you
    will need to learn something about <b>shells.</b>  The instructions
    below assume that you are using the T shell (tcsh), but MacOS now
    installs the z shell (zsh) by default, which is an extension of the
    Bourne shell (bash).  The basic installation is the same across
    shells, but each shell has a slightly different syntax for path
    specification, aliases, and so on.  Please should consult local
    documentation for details.

<p>
<li>Changes introduced with MacOS 10.15 (Catalina) cause certain Java
    applications to fail, but as of late 2023, CorpusSearch runs under
    MacOS 13 (Ventura) and MacOS 14 (Sonoma).

<p>
<li>Please be aware that if your operating system displays paths to you
    in a language other than English, it almost certainly still uses the
    English pathnames underlyingly.  For instance, on a Mac, a path
    that <u>appears</u> to you as "Applicazioni" or
    "Utenti/beatrice/Scrivania" will likely need to be specified by the
    English "Applications" or "Users/beatrice/Desktop".

<p>
<li>The following item may be outdated.  We leave it up in case it
    proves useful to some readers.  If you are using Windows, we
    recommend downloading a copy of the Java Virtual Machine (version
    1.4 or later) from the Sun java site
    (<a href="http://www.java.com/">http://www.java.com/</a>) rather
    than running Microsoft's Java.
    <p>
    Here's how to check which virtual machine you are running under Windows XP.
    <ul> 
    <li>Search for the Command Prompt by clicking on the "Run" icon
        on the Start menu.
    <li>Enter "cmd" in the dialog box that comes up.
    <li>Enter "C:\Documents and Settings\username>java -version" in 
        the Command Prompt dialog box that comes up.
    </ul>

</ul>

<a name="install">
<h3>Installing CorpusSearch</h3>

<ul>
<li>Download the latest version of CorpusSearch
    from <a href="https://corpussearch.sourceforge.net/">https://corpussearch.sourceforge.net/</a>,
    or use the version that comes with the LDC release of the Penn Parsed
    Corpora of Historical English.  In what follows, we assume that this
    is version CS_2.003.04.jar.

<p>
<li>Move the .jar file to a convenient location - for example, the
    "/Applications" folder under MacOS or the "Program Files" folder under
    Windows.

<p>
<li>Unix/Linux users (including MacOS):

<ul>
<p>
<li>Open a window that allows you to run commands - the Terminal program
    under MacOS or an xterm window under Unix or Linux.
  
<p>
<li>Assuming that you have moved CS_2.003.04.jar to the "/Applications"
    folder, enter the following line at the prompt in the terminal window.

<blockquote>
<pre>
java -classpath /Applications/CS_2.003.04.jar csearch/CorpusSearch
</pre>
</blockquote>

If you have moved the .jar file to some other location than /Applications,
edit the path accordingly.

<p>
<li>CorpusSearch should now prompt you for input.  If not, check the path
    to the .jar file.  Once you're prompted for input, follow the
    instructions to quit the search.  All you are doing at this point is
    checking that the path to the program is set up correctly.

<p>
<li>For convenience, you can add an alias for the above java command to
    your shell initialization file (for instance, .cshrc, .zshrc,
    .bashrc).  The following line will create such an alias in a .cshrc
    file:

<blockquote>
<pre>
alias CS 'java -classpath /Applications/CS_2.003.04.jar csearch/CorpusSearch'
</pre>
</blockquote>

Use the appropriate syntax for other shells.

Now you can invoke CorpusSearch with just "CS".

<p>
Again, if your operating system displays pathnames in a language other
than English, the alias in your shell initialization file almost certainly
needs to be specified in terms of the English directories.
</ul>

<p>
<li>Windows users:

<ul>
<p>
<li>Launch the Command Prompt via Start -> Run and enter "cmd" in the box
    ("command" under Windows 98).

<p>
<li>Enter the following command into the Command Prompt dialog box:

<blockquote>
<pre>
cd C:\
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li>Enter the following line at the resulting "C:\>" prompt:

<blockquote>
<pre>
java -classpath "C:\Program Files\CS_2.003.04.jar" csearch/CorpusSearch
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Be sure to include the quotation marks in the first argument after
"-classpath".  Also note the different direction of the slashes in the
first and the second argument (backward and forward, respectively).
</ul>

</ul>

<a name="run">
<h3>Running CorpusSearch</h3>

CorpusSearch is run from a terminal window (or "cmd" box) as described
above.  It needs two arguments to run: a command file and one or more
source files.  Assuming an alias "CS" as defined in the previous section,
the following command runs the query "foo.q" on the source file "bar.psd".

<blockquote>
<pre>
CS foo.q bar.psd
</pre>
</blockquote>

The above command assumes that the command file and source file are in the 
same directory as the one from which you're invoking CorpusSearch.  That 
will not generally be the case, and so you will need to specify full paths 
to the files in question.  You can use absolute paths, relative paths, and 
directory variables.  For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
CS /path/to/query/file/foo.q /path/to/source/file/bar.psd

CS ../queries/foo.q ../../corpus/bar.psd

CS ../$QUERY-DIR/foo.q $CORPUS-DIR/corpus/bar.psd
</pre>
</blockquote>

Using standard command line conventions, more than one file can be
searched in a single run.

<blockquote>
<pre>
CS $QUERIES/foo.q a*.psd *z.psd ~/some/other/directory/*.psd
</pre>
</blockquote>

CorpusSearch can also be invoked without any arguments.  It then prompts 
the user to enter the names of the command file and of the source file(s).

<a name="out-switch">
<p>
The search results are written to a file with the same basename as the
query file, but with the extension <b>.out</b> ("foo.out" in the case 
at hand).  The basename of the output file (but not the extension) can 
be changed with an "-out" switch.  Not "-o", but "-out".

<blockquote>
<pre>
CS foo.q bar.psd -out foo-on-bar.out

CS foo.q *.psd -out ALL.out
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
CorpusSearch reports any run-time errors in an error message, which by default 
is sent to the terminal screen.  Tracking down the error(s) generally requires 
redirecting the error message to a file.  For instance:

<blockquote>
<pre>
CS foo.q bar.psd >& ERR

CS foo.q *.psd >& help-me-debug
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<table border cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td><img src="hand.GIF">
<td>For large input files,  ERR files can become huge, to the extent 
that they fill up a disk (!).  The underlying problem is generally a 
missing paren in the input.  See <a href="troubleshooting.html#mismatched-parens">Mismatched 
parens</a> for troubleshooting advice.
</table>

<p>
Depending on the complexity of a query and the size of the source file(s), 
searches can take from a few seconds to a few hours.  To run a search in 
the background under Unix/Linux, add an ampersand (&) at the end of your 
command:

<blockquote>
<pre>
CS foo.q bar.psd &

CS foo.q bar.psd >& ERR &
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Before initiating a search in the background, make sure there is no .out
file corresponding to the query you intend to run.  If there is, your
search will <a href="troubleshooting.html#stalled-search" target="_new">stall</a>.
