This section gives tips on troubleshooting a number of common problems and
errors that arise when using CorpusSearch.  The reader is assumed to have
a general familiarity with the rest of the CorpusSearch manual.  In some
of the example queries, we make reference to a following definition file
with the following definition:

<blockquote>
<pre>
finite_verb:  BE[DP]|DO[DP]|HV[DP]|VB[DP]|MD
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="adjacent-pipe-symbols">
<h3>Adjacent pipe symbols</h3>

Adjacent pipe symbols (||) in a query will crash CorpusSearch.  The
adjacent pipe symbols may be in a definition file called by the query,
rather than in the query itself.  The error message will begin like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
ERROR!  In Meat.CrankThrough:  
Exception:  String index out of range: 0
String index out of range: 0
java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 0
java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 0
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="confusing-precedence-and-sisterhood">
<h3>Confusing (immediate) precedence and sisterhood</h3>

As mentioned in the entries
for <a href="search-functions.html#precedes" target="_new">precedes</a>
and <a href="search-functions.html#iPrecedes" target="_new">iPrecedes</a>
on the one hand and
<a href="search-functions.html#hasSister" target="_new">hasSister</a> on
the other, (immediate) precedence does not imply sisterhood, or vice
versa.  See the entries for the commands for examples.  The two relations
must be specified separately.

<a name="escaped-vs-bare-asterisks">
<h3>"Escaped" vs. bare asterisks</h3>

In connection with searching for expressions enclosed in asterisks like
traces and empty categories, it is necessary to carefully distinguish
between "\*" and "*".  The first expression (the "escaped" asterisk)
matches an asterisk character in the input, whereas the second expression
matches any string (including the null string).

<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>regular expression
<td>matches input string
<td>does not match input string
<tr>
<td>\*T\*
<td>*T*
<td>*T*-1, *T239, T, The, ATE, VAT
<tr>
<td>\*T\**
<td>*T*, *T*-1
<td>*T239, T, The, ATE, VAT
<tr>

<h3>Ill-formed input</h3>

<a name="redirecting-error-output">
<h4>Preliminary: Redirecting error output</h4>

When CorpusSearch encounters ill-formed input, it stops writing to the
output file and starts writing to standard output, which by default is the
terminal screen.  When debugging, particularly in connection
with <a href="#mismatched-parens">mismatched parens</a>, it is generally
necessary to redirect the output to a named error file (say, "ERR") by a
command along the following lines.

<blockquote>
<pre>
CS query.q file.psd >& ERR
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="mismatched-parens">
<p>
<h4>Mismatched parens</h4> 

The most seriously ill-formed input involves mismatched parens.
<!--which generally arise from editing a parsed file with an ordinary 
text editor like emacs rather than with Annotald or a similar program.-->

<ul>
<li>When CorpusSearch encounters a <u>superfluous</u> right paren, it
crashes and generates an error file (see <a href="installing.html#run">Running
CorpusSearch</a> for details).  Using the information in the error file,
these errors are easy to find and fix.

<p>
In the converse case of a <u>missing</u> right paren, CorpusSearch unfortunately
does not crash at the next wrapper paren.  Rather, it keeps looking for a matching
paren, continuing its search to the point of possibly gobbling up the entire rest
of the file.  In the case of a large file (as when correcting an entire corpus in
a single text file), if you are piping to an ERR file, that file can become so
humongous that it fills up your entire disk, leading to quite scary system error
messages.  If this happens, abort or kill the CS job, /bin/rm the ERR file, and
locate the source of the error using standard debugging procedures (by <u>making a
copy</u> of the input file</u>, preferably in a separate directory, and recursively
partitioning into parts and finding the part(s) with the error).

<p>
A handy way to implement this standard procedure (again, on a <u>debugging
copy</u>) using a text editor like emacs is is as follows:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Use the emacs command <tt>forward-sexp</tt> (or the equivalent in your text editor
of choice), which starts from some left paren and jumps to the corresponding right
paren.  You can invoke the command on the mode line with <tt>M-x forward-sexp</tt>,
or you can  bind the command to a sequence like <tt>C-x C-f</tt> in your .emacs file.  
In what follows, we assume the latter.

<p>
<li>
You can repeat <tt>forward-sexp</tt> arbitrarily many times by prefacing it with
<tt>C-u NUM</tt>, where <tt>NUM</tt> is the desired number of repetitions.

<blockquote>
<pre>
C-u 400 C-x C-f
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li>
A command of this form will either go to completion or result in an error message.
So set a beginning mark at the beginning of your debugging file (by adding, say,
"***" to the first token) and invoke the command with some <tt>NUM</tt>.  If the 
command goes to completion, set a new beginning point at the beginning of the next 
token and repeat.  If not, go back to the last beginning point and re-try with a 
smaller <tt>NUM</tt>.  Recursively repeat whichever step is appropriate, and you will 
eventually find the location of the missing paren.  Patience is the key.
</ul>

<p>
<li>CorpusSearch sometimes erroneously reports mismatched parens in
connection with certain characters, notably double quote.  A workaround is
to replace the offending character, at least temporarily, by some innocuous
character sequence like <tt>&lt;double-quote&gt;</tt>.
</ul>

<p>
<a name="missing-wrapper-parens">
<h4>Missing wrapper parens</h4>

Wrapper parens are the unlabeled parens that delimit each token in Penn
Treebank format, as shown in (1a).  If the wrapper parens are missing, the 
token looks like (1b), and you will have to add the relevant parens in order 
to meet the CorpusSearch's <a href="compatibility.html" target="_new">compatibility 
requirements</a>.

<blockquote>
<pre>
(1) a.  ( (IP-MAT ... ))

    b.    (IP-MAT ... )
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="other">
<h4>Other ill-formed input sequences</h4>

CorpusSearch helpfully breaks on various other ill-formed input
sequences like the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(2) a.  ( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (PRO$ My) (N neighbor))
                  (VBD told)
                  me                                    &larr; bare word (missing preterminal)
          (. .)))

    b.  ( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (PRO$ My) (N neighbor))
                  (VBD told)
                  (NP-OB2 (PRO m e))			&larr; terminal contains space
          (. .)))

    c.  ( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (PRO$ My                      &larr; preterminal isn't unary-branching
                                (N neighbor)))
                  (VBD told)
                  (NP-OB2 (PRO me)))
          (. .))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="missing-asterisk">
<h3>Missing asterisk</h3>

In general, it is wise to be liberal with asterisks and to omit them
only if you are sure that you <u>don't</u> need them.  For instance,
"NP-SBJ" as a search term finds only a subset of subjects.  It
does not match subjects that are resumptive ("NP-SBJ-RSP"),
coindexed with a clause ("NP-SBJ-1"), or with any other
additional material after the dash tag.  Using "NP-SBJ*" will
find all subjects, no matter what might be added on to the end of the
label.

<p>
When you want to refer to all the variants of a label except for one or
two, you have to explicitly list all the desired variants.  For
instance, if you are interested in all instances of "ADVP*"
except for "ADVP-DIR", you must use a disjunction like the
following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
ADVP|ADVP-LOC*|ADVP-TMP*
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In such cases, best practice is to include the disjunction in a
<a href="def.html" target="_new">definition file</a>.

<a name="missing-define">
<h3>Missing "define"</h3>

A common error is to intend to use a definition file, but to omit the
requisite "define" command in
the <a href="command-file.html#preamble" target="_new">preamble</a>.
CorpusSearch issues no warning message, but the search will not yield the
intended output because CorpusSearch interprets the strings intended as
definitions as literal strings, which generally do not match anything in
the input.

<p>
For more details and suggestions for troubleshooting,
see <a href="def.html#output" target="_new">Definition file</a>.

<a name="missing-prefix-indices">
<h3>Missing prefix indices</h3>

A very common error is to forget to add prefix indices to arguments of a
search function (in other words, to unintentionally impose same-instance).
This is the chief cause of a baffling absence of hits.  Here is an example
of a query intended to find clauses in which both the subject and the
object are prounous.

<blockquote>
<pre>
query:    (NP-SBJ* iDoms PRO)
      AND (NP-OB1* iDoms PRO)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This query can never return any hits, because the two instances of PRO
are interpreted by default as referring to the same node.  But that
configuration is not a possible tree structure, as one and the same node
cannot be simultaneously dominated by the subject and the object.  The
two instances of PRO must be distinguished with prefix indices:

<blockquote>
<pre>
query:    (NP-SBJ* iDoms [1]PRO)
      AND (NP-OB1* iDoms [2]PRO)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="missing-same-instance">
<h3>Missing same-instance</h3>

Errors due by <a href="#missing-prefix-indices">missing prefix indices</a>
are cases of unintentionally overusing same-instance.  Same-instance can
also be underused, as in the following query, intended to retrieve
instances of V2 with clause-initial adverb phrases.

<blockquote>
<pre>
query:    (IP* iDomsFirst ADVP*)
      AND (finite_verb iPrecedes NP-SBJ*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The intended instances will be retrieved, but so will unintended tokens
like the following, where the finite verb and the subject are not
clausemates of the adverb phrase, as clearly indicated by the node indices
in the <a href="understanding-output.html#output" target="_new">result
block</a>.

<blockquote>
<pre>
/*
1 IP-MAT:  1 IP-MAT, 2 ADVP-TMP, 16 BEP, 18 NP-SBJ
*/
(0  (1 IP-MAT (2 ADVP-TMP (3 ADV Yesterday))
	      (5 NP-SBJ (6 PRO they))
	      (8 VBD asked)
	      (10 , ,)
	      (12 " ")
	      (14 CP-QUE-MAT-SPE (15 IP-SUB-SPE (16 BEP Are)
						(18 NP-SBJ (19 PRO you))
						(21 VAG coming)
						(23 PP (24 P with)
						       (26 NP (27 PRO us)))))
	      (29 . ?)
	      (31 " ")))
</pre>
</blockquote>

The reason for this error is that the query fails to impose the
clausemate condition.  The solution is to "tie" the constituents in the
second clause of the query to one or more constituents in the first
clause of the query by exploiting same-instance.  Here is one way of
doing that:

<blockquote>
<pre>
query:    (IP* iDomsNumber 1 ADVP*)
      AND (IP* iDomsNumber 2 finite_verb)
      AND (IP* iDomsNumber 3 NP-SBJ*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here is another way:

<blockquote>
<pre>
query:    (IP* iDomsFirst ADVP*)
      AND (ADVP* hasSister finite_verb)
      AND (finite_verb hasSister NP-SBJ*)
      AND (ADVP* iPrecedes finite_verb)
      AND (finite_verb iPrecedes NP-SBJ*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="redundant-exists">
<h3>Redundant "exists"</h3>

<p>
The following query is not ill-formed, but it is inefficient.

<blockquote>
<pre>
query:     (NP-SBJ* exists) 
       AND (ADJ exists)
       AND (NP-SBJ* iDoms ADJ)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The final clause in the query implies the two preceding ones, and the
same effect can therefore be obtained more simply with:

<blockquote>
<pre>
query:     (NP-SBJ* iDoms ADJ)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="stalled-search">
<h3>Stalled search</h3>

Before running a CorpusSearch job in the background, make sure there is
no .out file corresponding to the query you intend to run.  CorpusSearch
ordinarily warns you that it is about to overwrite the existing .out
file and prompts you to allow the search to go forward.  But if you
background the job, the prompt is backgrounded too and you never get a
chance to permit the search.  As a result, the command stalls and will
have to be killed.

<p>
The above scenario is a common cause of searches that take an
unexpectedly long time.  (This can be confirmed with Unix/Linux's 
"jobs" command.)
