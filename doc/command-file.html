<a name="introduction">
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
In this section, we present the most basic type of a CorpusSearch command
file: the ordinary query file.  Other types of command files are similar
in form, but have different functions, and it is convenient to discuss
them separately:

<ul>
<li><a href="coding.html" target="_new">Coding</a>
<li><a href="revision.html" target="_new">Corpus revision</a>
<li><a href="lexicon.html" target="_new">Lexicon creation</a>
<li><a href="frames.html" target="_new">Local frames</a>
</ul>

Ordinary query files must have names ending in the extension <b>.q</b>.
By default, their output has the same basename as the query file, but the
extension is <b>.out</b>.  The basename of the output file (but not the
.out extension) can be changed with an "-out" switch</a> on the
command line (see
<a href="installing.html#out-switch" target="_new">Installing
CorpusSearch</a>).

<a name="preamble">
<p>
The command file for an ordinary CorpusSearch query has the following
schematic form.  Obligatory components are underlined:

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Preamble
    <ul>
    <li><u>Node specification</u>
    <li>"Ignore" commands
    <li>Output format commands
    <li>Reference to a <a href="def.html" target="_new">definition file</a>
    </ul>
<li><u>Command specification</u>
</ul>
</blockquote>

Here is an example:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
// node specification
node: IP-MAT*

// "ignore" command
ignore_nodes: null

// output specification
print_indices: t

// definition file
define: mideng.def

// command specification - find short examples for slides
query: (IP-MAT* iDomsTotal< 10)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The commands in the preamble must all precede the search specification,
but the various components of the preamble can appear in any order.  They
are read in order.  This means that the node specification can reference a
label from a <a href="def.html" target="_new">definition file</a>, but
only if "define:" precedes "node:" in the command file.

<a name="boolean">
<h3>Notational variants for Boolean values</h3>

CorpusSearch allows the following notational variants for Boolean values:

<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>true
<td>t, true, T, TRUE
<tr>
<td>false
<td>f, false, F, FALSE
</table>

<a name="node">
<a name="root">
<a name="metaroot">
<h3>Node specification</h3>

<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="hand.GIF">
<td>The issue of node choice is perhaps less confusing than it used to be
    given the advent of coding queries, where the effects of node choice
    are more transparent.
</table>

<p>
The "node" command specifies the search domain within which CorpusSearch
attempts to execute the search specification.  Possible values for the
node specification are:

<ul>
<li>$ROOT, a variable that stands for the root node of a sentence token,
    whatever its label may be and even when it has no
    label. (See <a href="#nodes_only">nodes_only</a> for the effect of
    that command on the value of $ROOT in subsequent searches.)
<p>
<li>$METAROOT, the mother of $ROOT, which generally has no label.  The
    associated parens are known as wrapper parens.  A common use for
    $METAROOT is to check whether every sentence token has an associated
    ID node.
<p>
<li>a literal node label in the corpus
<p>
<li>a <a href="query-language.html#reg-exps" target="_new">regular expression</a>
    referring to a set of node labels in the corpus
<p>
<li>an expression defined in the <a href="def.html" target="_new">definition file</a>
    (in this case, "define:" must precede "node:" in the preamble)
</ul>

The choice of node boundary determines the following:

<ul>
<li>how hits are counted, hits being defined as "number of distinct node
    boundaries matching the query"
<li>which nodes are removed if <a href="#remove_nodes">remove_nodes</a>
    is true
<li>which nodes are printed if <a href="#nodes_only">nodes_only</a> is true
</ul>

We illustrate this by running the same query on the same simple
sentence, but with different node boundaries.  Given the following query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
node: IP-MAT*

query: (NP* iDoms PRO*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

CorpusSearch counts 1 hit because even though there are 2 NP* nodes that
match the query, they are contained within a single instance of IP-MAT*.

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*
and he made them grete chere out of mesure
(CMMALORY,2.13)
*~/
/*
1 IP-MAT:  4 NP-SBJ, 5 PRO
1 IP-MAT:  9 NP-OB2, 10 PRO
*/
(0 (1 IP-MAT (2 CONJ and)
	     (4 NP-SBJ (5 PRO he))
	     (7 VBD made)
	     (9 NP-OB2 (10 PRO them))
	     (12 NP-OB1 (13 ADJ grete) (15 N chere))
	     (17 ADVP (18 ADV out)
		      (20 PP (21 P of)
			     (23 NP (24 N mesure)))))
  (26 ID CMMALORY,2.13)) 

/*
SUMMARY:  
source files, hits/tokens/total
  CMMALORY			1/1/1
whole search, hits/tokens/total
				1/1/1
*/
</pre>
</blockquote>

Running the same query with node boundary NP* yields a different result:

<blockquote>
<pre>
node: NP*

query: (NP* iDoms PRO*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

Now CorpusSearch counts 2 hits, because each of the 2 instances of NP*
is an instance of the node boundary:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*
and he made them grete chere out of mesure
(CMMALORY,2.13)
*~/
/*
4 NP-SBJ:  4 NP-SBJ, 5 PRO
9 NP-OB2:  9 NP-OB2, 10 PRO
*/
(0 (1 IP-MAT (2 CONJ and)
	     (4 NP-SBJ (5 PRO he))
	     (7 VBD made)
	     (9 NP-OB2 (10 PRO them))
	     (12 NP-OB1 (13 ADJ grete) (15 N chere))
	     (17 ADVP (18 ADV out)
	              (20 PP (21 P of)
		             (23 NP (24 N mesure)))))
    (26 ID CMMALORY,2.13))
/*
SUMMARY:  
source files, hits/tokens/total
  CMMALORY		2/1/1
whole search, hits/tokens/total
			2/1/1
*/
</pre>
</blockquote>

The way that CorpusSearch counts hits in this case becomes particularly
clear if we set "<a href="#nodes_only">nodes_only</a>" to "true":

<blockquote>
<pre>
node: NP*

nodes_only: t

query: (NP* iDoms PRO*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

This yields the following output:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*
and he made them grete chere out of mesure
(CMMALORY,2.13)
*~/
/*
4 NP-SBJ:  4 NP-SBJ, 5 PRO

*/
( (4 NP-SBJ (5 PRO he))
  (26 ID CMMALORY,2.13))

  (26 ID CMMALORY,2.13)) 
/*

*/
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="ignore">
<h3>Ignoring nodes in searches</h3>

Certain node labels in the corpus indicate metalinguistic or other
information that should generally not be considered in searches.  For
instance, an intervening editorial comment, line break, page number, and
the like should not affect searches involves immediate precedence.  It is
also often (though not always) desirable to ignore punctuation, traces,
other empty categories, and clitics.  Some of these items should also
generally be ignored when counting the number of words in a constituent.
In deciding whether a given structure in the corpus matches a query,
CorpusSearch ignores nodes with labels on the
"<a href="#ignore_nodes">ignore_nodes</a>" list.  In connection with
<a href="search-functions.html#domsWords" target="_new">domsWords</a> and
its variants, CorpusSearch uses the
"<a href="#ignore_words">ignore_words</a>" list instead.  Labels can be
added to these lists using "<a href="#add_to_ignore">add_to_ignore</a>"
and "<a href="#add_to_ignore_words">add_to_ignore_words</a>",
respectively, or they can be revised more extensively (including the
option of not ignoring any nodes or words), as discussed under the
commands at issue.  Any of the commands mentioned in this paragraph can be
specified in the <a href="pref.html" target="_new">preference file</a> or
in individual command files, where, as usual, they override any preference
file specifications.

<p>
The following table is intended as a convenient summary of the commands in
this section.  For more details, see the entries for the individual
commands.

    target="_new">preference file</a>).
</table>

<p>
"ignore_nodes" tells CorpusSearch to ignore the specified nodes in
connection with all search functions except for
<a href="search-functions.html#domsWords">domsWords</a> and its
variants.  (For the latter, CorpusSearch uses the list specified
by <a href="command-file.html#ignore_words">ignore_words</a>.)  For
instance, running this query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP* iPrecedes PP*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

returns the following sentence despite the CODE node intervening between
NP-1 and PP.  This is because the label "CODE" is on the default
"ignore_nodes" list.

<blockquote>

                 (22 E_S ,))
   (24 ID CMMALORY,15.439))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
You can replace the default list with a list of your own choosing, and
you can also tell CorpusSearch not to ignore any nodes with this
command:

<blockquote>
<pre>
ignore_nodes: null
</pre>
</blockquote>

</table>

<p>
Here is an example of an incoherent query that makes reference to a node
on the ignore_nodes list:

<blockquote>
<pre>

ignore_nodes: NP*

query:  (NP* iDoms PRO*)

Running the query on the following input:

		             (23 NP (24 N mesure)))))
    (26 ID CMMALORY,2.13))
</pre>
</blockquote>

yields an output file without any hits.

<blockquote>

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> This is because CorpusSearch is literally following your instruction
to ignore all NP* nodes, including the NP* nodes with node addresses 4 and
9, which would otherwise match the query.

<a name="add_to_ignore">
<h4>add_to_ignore: {list_of_labels}</h4>

<b>Default:</b> n/a

<p>
"add_to_ignore" adds nodes to the "ignore_nodes" list (whether the default
list or your own).  For instance:

<blockquote>
<pre>
add_to_ignore: INTJ*              &larr; "add_to_ignore", not "add_to_ignore_nodes"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="ignore_words">

<p>
"ignore_words" tells CorpusSearch what nodes to ignore when counting words
in connection with <a href="search-functions.html#domsWords"
target="_new">domsWords</a> and its variants.  (For all other search
functions, CorpusSearch uses the list specified
in <a href="#ignore_nodes">ignore_nodes</a>.)  The default list for
"ignore_words" is the same list as for "ignore_nodes", except that it also
includes "0" and traces and empty categories (expressions beginning with
asterisk).  Nodes on the "ignore_words" list can be terminals or
preterminals (in other words, either elements of the text itself or their
associated POS tag).

<p>
As with the <a href="#ignore_nodes">ignore_nodes</a> list, you can edit
the "ignore_words" list, replacing the default list with a list of your
own or with the value "null" (if you want to count all terminal nodes in
the text, without ignoring any).

<a name="add_to_ignore_words">
<h4>add_to_ignore_words: {list_of_labels} </h4>

<b>Default:</b> n/a

<p>
"add_to_ignore_words" add nodes to the "ignore_words" list (whether the
default list or your own).  For instance:

<blockquote>
<pre>
add_to_ignore_words: [oO]h
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="corpus_encoding">
<h3>Corpus encoding</h3>

<b>Default:</b> corpus_encoding: US-ASCII

<p>
CorpusSearch also supports ISO-LATIN-1 (a.k.a ISO-8859-1), UTF-8, and UTF-16.

<a name="output_format">
<h3>Output format commands</h3>

Output format commands control how search results are printed to the
output file.  They do not influence the results of a current search.
However, because they can cause the output of the current search to
include certain nodes or not, they may influence the contents of
searches that depend on the output of the current one.

<p>
The following table is intended as a convenient summary of the commands
in this section.  For more details, see the entries for the individual
commands.

<p>
<table>

</table>

<a name="remark">
<h4>begin_remark: {remark string} end_remark</h4>

<b>Default:</b> n/a

<p>
This two-part command tells CorpusSearch to print a remark in the
preface to the output; for instance, a note about the purpose of a
particular search.  The following command:

<blockquote>
<pre>
begin_remark: 
pronoun objects
end_remark
</pre>
</blockquote>

would give rise to an output preface as follows:

<blockquote>
<pre>

</blockquote>

<a name="nodes_only">
<h4>nodes_only: (Boolean true or false) </h4>

<b>Default:</b> false

<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="hand.GIF">
<td>When the output of some initial search that
    sets <a href="#nodes_only">nodes_only</a> to "true" becomes the input

    root of the output trees, whose label is determined by (though not
    necessarily identical with) the <a href="#node">node boundary</a> of
    the initial search.
</table>

<p>
If "nodes_only" is set to true, CorpusSearch prints out only
the <a href="#node">nodes</a> that match the query.  If it is set to
false, CorpusSearch prints out the entire sentence token containing the
structure matching the query.  For instance, with the default value of
"false", the following query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
node: ADVP*

nodes_only: f

query:  (ADVP* iDoms ADVP*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

gives the following output:

<blockquote>

The output for the same query, but with "nodes_only" set to "true",
looks like this:

</table>

<p>
CorpusSearch ordinarily outputs only nodes or tokens that match the
search specification.  Setting "print_complement" to "true" causes
CorpusSearch to print the matching tokens to the regular output file
(with the extension <b>.out</b>) and also all the tokens that don't
match to a separate complement file (with the extension <b>.cmp</b>).
In other words, "print_complement" applies logical NOT to an entire
query.

<p>
For instance, the following query could be used on an input file
containing all IPs with objects in order to divide those IPs into two
complementary sets: those with two objects (in the .out file) and the
remainder (with at most one object).

<blockquote>
<pre>
print_complement: t

node: IP*

query:    (IP* iDoms NP-OB1)
      AND (IP* iDoms NP-OB2)
</pre>
</blockquote>

Here is an example from the regular output file.  It matches the query
and has two objects:

And here is an example from the complement file.  It has only one object
and so fails to match the query.

<td>The "print_complement" command should only be used on the output of a
    previous search that has yielded some set that it is sensible to
    divide into two complementary subsets.  Using a query with
    "print_complement" on an entire corpus will generally result in a .cmp
    file consisting of a grab bag of tokens without any theoretical
    significance.
</table>

<a name="print_indices">
<h4>print_indices: (Boolean true or false)</h4>

<b>Default:</b> false

<p>
"print_indices" tells CorpusSearch whether to print node address indices
in the output.  Node address indices should not be confused
with <a href="query-language.html#prefix-indices" target="_new">prefix
indices</a> (though prefix indices use addresses to fix the reference of
search arguments).  Node address indices start at 0
for <a href="#metaroot">$METAROOT</a> and systematically label every node
in the tree, including the word (terminal nodes).  By convention,
addresses for terminals are not printed even when "print_indices" is set
to "true".

<p>
Here's a piece of output structure with and without node addresses:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(10 NP-OB1 (11 NPR Morgan)     &larr; indices 12 "Morgan", 14 "le", 16 "Fay" omitted by convention
           (13 NPR le)
           (15 NPR Fay))

(NP-OB1 (NPR Morgan)
        (NPR le)
        (NPR Fey))
</pre>
</blockquote>

Output including index queries can be a bit cumbersome to read, but when
troubleshooting a query that isn't having the intended effect, indices
in the tree structures are invaluable pointers for understanding what
CorpusSearch is matching and where the query needs to be revised.  This
is also true more generally in connection with complex queries or with
corpora with very long sentence tokens.

<a name="remove_nodes">
<h4>remove_nodes: (Boolean true or false)</h4>

<b>Default:</b> false

<p>
"remove_nodes" removes subtrees rooted in the same syntactic category as
the node boundary when the subtrees are themselves dominated by an
instance of that category (see below for details as to what counts as
the "same").  The removed subtree is replaced by a label indicating the
material that has been removed.  If the removed subtree itself matches
the query, it will appear in its complete form as a separate output
token later in the output file.

<p>
CorpusSearch determines the syntactic category of the nodes to be removed
according to the following algorithm:

<p>
<ul>
<li>If the node boundary label contains any hyphens, the node's
    syntactic category is the substring of the label up to the leftmost
    hyphen, followed by an asterisk.
<li>If the node boundary label does not contain a hyphen, but does
    contain a trailing asterisk, the label is used as is.  
<li>If the node boundary label contains neither a hyphen nor a trailing
    asterisk, an asterisk is appended to the label.
</ul>

<p>
For instance, all of the following node boundaries - IP-MAT-PRN*, IP*,
IP - yield IP* as the syntactic category to be removed.

<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="caution.GIF">
<td>All NP node boundaries yield NP* as the node to be removed.  In
    addition to matching NPs, this will also match the POS tag NPR, which
    is likely not intended.  To avoid this problem, add a hyphen ("NP-*")
    to the node boundary.  A more radical solution is to replace "NPR" by
    a non-interfering label like "NR" 
    via a <a href="revision.html" target="_new">revision query</a> or a
    sed script.
</table>

<p>
In the following command file, "remove_nodes" is set to "true":

<blockquote>
<pre>
node: IP*

remove_nodes: true

query: (NP-OB* iDoms PRO)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Running it on the following input

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (IP-MAT (CONJ and)
          (NP-SBJ *con*)
          (VBD counceilled)

          (PUNC .))
  (ID CMMALORY-M4,14.416))

yields the following output:

<blockquote>

The structure of the infinitival IP "to folowe hem no further" is removed
in the first hit and replaced with the label "RMV:{rmv_string}", where
"rmv_string" stands for the concatenation of (up to) the first three words
(terminal nodes) of the removed material.

<!--
<p>
Further searches on the output file above will be able to search only
IP* nodes with pronoun objects.  If "nodes_only" were set to "false",
this restriction would not hold.

<a name="ur_text_only">
<h4>ur_text_only: (Boolean true or false)</h4>

<b>Default:</b> false

<p>
"ur_text" refers to the text in its unannotated form.  "ur_text_only"
prints only the ur_text of the tokens matching the query, suppressing
printing of the labeled bracketing and associated information.

<a name="command-spec">
<a name="query">

<h3>Command specification</h3>

<h4>query</h4>

Every command file must contain a command specification, which instructs
CorpusSearch as to what action to carry out on the input.  The command
specification for ordinary queries is:

<blockquote>
</pre>
query: { condition(s) }
</pre>
</blockquote>

The conditions contain one or
more <a href="search-functions.html" target="_new">search functions</a> in accordance
with the syntax of the CorpusSearch <a href="query-language.html" target="_new">query
language</a>.

<a name="reformat">
<h4>reformat_corpus</h4>

A command file consisting of only the following command specification
(without a preamble):

<blockquote>
<pre>
reformat_corpus: t
</pre>
</blockquote>

normalizes the format of an input file (adjusting indentation, spacing,
and so on).  The output has the extension <b>.fmt</b>, which is appended
to the full name of the input file, including any existing extensions.

<p>
The "reformat_corpus" command can be thought of as applying a vacuous
query to a file.  The result is an output file formatted according to the
same rules as would apply with an ordinary query.

<p>
"reformat_corpus" is useful for following up with Unix "diff" when
comparing two versions of the same file or corpus - say, before and after
running a <a href="revision.html" target="_new">corpus revision query</a>.

<a name="comments">
<h3>Comments</h3>

Comments may appear anywhere in a command file.  They are also allowed
anywhere in the input file(s).

<p>
By default, single-line comments are introduced by "//", and multi-line
comments (block comments) appear between "/*" and "*/".  These comment
delimiters can be changed for input files, <u>but not for command
files</u>.

<p>
The command "corpus_line_comment" changes the line comment delimiter.
For instance:

<blockquote>
<pre>
corpus_line_comment: \\
</pre>
</blockquote>

The paired commands "corpus_comment_begin" and "corpus_comment_end" change
the block comment delimiters.  For instance:

<blockquote>
<pre>
corpus_comment_begin: <+
corpus_comment_end: +>
</pre>
</blockquote>
